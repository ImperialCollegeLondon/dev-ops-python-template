This is a section detailing practices for Jupyter notebooks. There is an example notebook included.


# General Best Practice

Generally, you should use Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and for analysing outputs of models. They can also be good ways of making examples for non-progammers (or scientists-turned-programmers!) to use. Avoid writing lots of python into the notebooks and break these out into reusable functions with unit tests. This means you cna re-use your code!
